exhibition</h3>\n\n<p>\u2018Thinking Out Loud\u2019 is the fifth Data as Culture art exhibition at the Open Data Institute. The exhibition is built around the practice of the 2016 ODI Sound Artist in Residence, Alex McLean, with a group of artists, designers, makers and musicians that he has collaborated with. Openness and processes of making \u2013 where any end results are left partly undone \u2013 are at the heart of many of the projects on display. The exhibition draws connections between the ways in which humans have captured, encoded and distributed data, and made it meaningful through pattern throughout history. From pre-Columbian Quipu and the ancient art of weaving to computer software environments, it introduces us to creative notions of code, and the ways in which it can carry both language and thought. </p>\n\n<p>The exhibition features artists and makers who are driven by radical intentions to expose the inner workings of the systemic structures we live with. We are encouraged to engage with these ourselves through art, software, folk songs, glitch aesthetics, chance encounters and knitted jumpers.</p>\n\n<h3>Book a visit</h3>\n\n<p>The artwork is displayed in the working offices of the Open Data Institute, so for a viewing please contact <a

It underpins business innovation, transparency, accountability, business innovation and civil society. But we are not giving it the same importance as traditional infrastructure such as our road, rail and energy networks. We need to strengthen the technology, processes, and organisations that make up our data infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Finance is a broad sector</strong>. It includes consumers, banks, digital currencies, payment infrastructure, financial institutions, markets, supply chains and regulators. Across the sector, there\u2019s information and data that everybody needs; there\u2019s data that\u2019s shared between institutions and with markets; and there\u2019s data used only within a single business.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Topics covered</strong></p>\n\n<p>During flasktalks, panel discission and Q&amp;A, we will also cover:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The application of distributed technologies such as blockchains to data infrastructure</li>\n  <li>How to design data infrastructure that is as reliable and open as possible</li>\n  <li>How to manage personal data with privacy and openness</li>\n  <li>How to encourage open innovation</li>\n  <li>The connections between finance data infrastructure and that in other sectors</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Speakers and panelists will be announced in due course.</em></p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/odi-futures-data-infrastructure-for-finance-tickets-25538683891\">Book now</a> </p>\n\n<p>Join the discussion on Twitter using #ODIFutures and #DataInfrastructure.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About ODI Futures</strong></p>\n\n<p>ODI Futures events bring business, government and academia together to examine the potential for open data in different sectors.

The devices, called <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.datacatcher.org/\">Datacatchers</a>, show a stream of information drawn from numerous open and shared databases about their local surroundings. With information from the census, marketing sites, governmental agencies, and social media, they mutually illuminate the sociopolitical topology of the UK and the ways data represents that topology \u2013 and allow people to speak back by way of a series of somewhat irreverent poll questions. In this talk we describe the making of the Datacatchers, and show a few of the 50+ documentary videos we commissioned to build a picture of peoples&rsquo; experiences.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/wgaver\">Bill Gaver</a> is Professor of Design and leads the Interaction Research Studio at Goldsmiths, University of London.

Gathering from the virtual, playing in the physical she navigates the grey areas, the cracks and slippage between right and wrong.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"www.natashacaruana.com\">www.natashacaruana.com</a></p>\n\n<hr />\n<iframe src=\"//eventbrite.co.uk/tickets-external?eid=17564688456&amp;ref=etckt\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"214\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n","excerpt":"You bring your lunch, we provide tea & coffee, an interesting talk, and enough time to get back to your desk.","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"end_date":"2015-07-17T13:50:00+01:00","location":"The Open Data Institute, 65 Clifton Street, London, EC2A 4JE","start_date":"2015-07-17T13:00:00+01:00","booking_url":"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/friday-lunchtime-lecture-love-data-and-art-collide-tickets-17564688456","hashtag":"ODIFridays","alternative_title":"ODIFridays at the Open Data Insitute","event_type":"event:lunchtime-lecture","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/friday-lunchtime-lecture-improving-banking-services-making-better-use-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/lunchtime-lectures/friday-lunchtime-lecture-improving-banking-services-making-better-use-open-data","slug":"friday-lunchtime-lecture-improving-banking-services-making-better-use-open-data","title":"Friday lunchtime lecture: Improving banking services by making better use of open data","format":"event","updated_at":"2015-12-04T15:02:04+00:00","created_at":"2015-11-12T16:08:03+00:00","tag_ids":["event:lunchtime-lecture","odifridays","banking","events","lunchtime-lecture","open-banking-working-group"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/events/event%3Alunchtime-lecture.json","web_url":null,"title":"Lunchtime Lecture","details":{"description":"Lunchtime Lecture","short_description":null,"type":"event"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?event=event%3Alunchtime-lecture","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/event:lunchtime-lecture","slug":"event:lunchtime-lecture"},"parent":null},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/odifridays.json","web_url":null,"title":"ODIFridays","details":{"description":null,"short_description":null,"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=odifridays","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/odifridays","slug":"odifridays"},"parent":null},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/banking.json","web_url":null,"title":"banking","details":{"description":null,"short_description":null,"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=banking","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/banking","slug":"banking"},"parent":null},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/events.json","web_url":null,"title":"events","details":{"description":null,"short_description":null,"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=events","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/events","slug":"events"},"parent":null},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/lunchtime-lecture.json","web_url":null,"title":"lunchtime lecture","details":{"description":null,"short_description":null,"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=lunchtime-lecture","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/lunchtime-lecture","slug":"lunchtime-lecture"},"parent":null},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/open-banking-working-group.json","web_url":null,"title":"open banking working group","details":{"description":null,"short_description":null,"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=open-banking-working-group","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/open-banking-working-group","slug":"open-banking-working-group"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Aidor4-dVgU?showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/4a/f2/564af2d51f986a0848000001/3372484550_96c605b0bf_z.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img pull-right\" id=\"attachment-564af2d5f362be07fb000004\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Friday lunchtime lectures are for everyone and are free to attend.

<a href=\"https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Search\">Contracts Finder</a>, a portal that advertises open government-spending contract opportunities, allowing companies to easily and quickly bid for them. The UK spends \u00a3250 billion every year on public spending contracts, including vital public services like the NHS and it\u2019s important that this money is spent as efficiently as possible.</p>\n\n<p>As part of an ASI fellowship, William Jones worked in collaboration with the UK Cabinet Office to increase the number of companies bidding on these contracts. He did this by automatically recommending them contracts which are available and relevant, using publicly accessible information from UK companies. The web application William built is called <a href=\"https://contract-recommender.herokuapp.com/\">Contracts Recommender</a>. His talk will explain the public sources of information he uses as well as how Contracts Recommender works.</p>\n\n<p><i><b>William Jones</b> was recently awarded the MPhil in Advanced Computer Science from the Cambridge Computer Laboratory with Distinction. During the ASI fellowship he first worked on a deep learning image classification project with <a href=\"http://tractable.io/\">Tractable.io</a>, using the convolutional neural network framework Caffe. Following this he joined a project with the Cabinet Office using natural language processing to automatically recommend relevant government procurement contracts to companies in the UK. He has just started a PhD in Mathematical Genomics at Cambridge.</i>\n\n<br />\n<h2> About our Friday lunchtime lectures </h2>\n<p>With a broad range of topics in open data such as tracking government expenditure, British landscape mapping and creating art, there\u2019s bound to be something that interests you.</p> \n\n<p>The sessions run from 1pm to 1.45pm weekly during UK school term-times, with informal networking until 2pm.

The problem is, the global population is expanding and companies like North Pole Inc. everywhere are being forced to find new, more efficient ways of delivering services. </p>\n\n<p>This year, a crack team at North Pole Inc. has been working on developing and implementing the data infrastructure that Christmas needs, to keep children happy for years to come. </p>\n\n<p>Join us on 18 December to hear from North Pole Inc. <strong>CEO, Santa Claus; Head of Deliveries, Reiner Deerdale and Chief Elf Envisioner Sparkle Wonderdust</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>Look out for surprise guests!</p>\n\n<p><small class=\"pull-right\"><i>Photo: Flickr -<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregloby/3083873075/in/photolist-vWbF2G-iAwxWa-M6Qq1-fKBtV6-cpCkU-bRTWGn-4NpR81-7LNe1H-o1mFkN-rxwUBe-55GvQS-nrJbzn-93UEHF-6wKAPE-4DPCva-5GSnPt-4G6pp9-6mTTHR-hub9f-dyJ7de-qUiG12-5yMWoC-ziJkU9-e9r6yc-d3ycyu-cKrx1W-4oo77A-iz7Jw1-yaSnk-rRRMKF-6VAyq-e582An-aGhST-qjNVG2-4gxNTE-oMjSM6-fZoiTS-iqNVRR-ixVBiS-pda55o-5GvE2r-qp8u73-qa9sHx-ziKsnq-rWRtow-iaXnrH-9MHnEM-gUWopL-61tSB5-86iYQS\"> Greg Lobinski (CC-BY-2.0)</a></i></small></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Book your place</h3>\n\n<iframe src=\"//eventbrite.co.uk/tickets-external?eid=19800719485&amp;ref=etckt\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"214\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>About our Friday lunchtime lectures</h3>\n\n<p>With a broad range of topics in open data such as tracking government expenditure, British landscape mapping and creating art, there\u2019s bound to be something that interests you. </p>\n\n<p>The sessions run from 1pm to 1.45pm weekly during UK school term-times, with informal networking until 2pm.

Users can then explore the data they record in weekly, customised emails and a personalisable online dashboard. </p>\n\n<p>Plexus also uses machine learning to direct users to its knowledge base, which aggregates data sourced from over 25 different government services, NGOs and charities including <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mind.org.uk/?gclid=CJqh3vmY3swCFQUq0wodfV4ETQ\">Mind</a>, Martin Lewis&rsquo;s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/\">Money Saving Expert</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://england.shelter.org.uk/donate/100khomelesschildren?gclid=CJ6g6I2Z3swCFbYK0wod-tYNyw\">Shelter</a>. Open data sits at the heart of this process, from supporting users learn to helping develop Grace&rsquo;s ability to understand and predict. A primary goal for Plexus is to produce meaningful open datasets that have the power to shape service provision on a regional and national level.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/friday-lunchtime-lecture-meet-grace-a-bot-to-boost-your-wellbeing-at-work-tickets-25476929181?ref=ebtn\"><img src=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/custombutton?eid=25476929181\" /></a></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>About Martin Vowles</h3>\n\n<p><em>Martin Vowles is Creative Director &amp; co-Founder of M/A and also CEO of Plexus.

Open data has great potential to help drive poverty eradication and improve global development outcomes. Data usage, however, remains relatively low. In the UK, for instance, a third of the datasets found on the government\u2019s online portal have never been used. </p>\n\n<p>One reason for this is because it is hard to join-up data relating to funding, people and outcomes since it is published in different formats, and to different standards. This means that potential users of the data can\u2019t easily see how various bits of data relate to each other. </p>\n\n<p>The Joined-Up Data Standards project has been exploring how data standards can be joined-up, using linked data and semantic mapping.

While the UK government is currently investing in the \u201cbest\u201d ways to plan, create, and fund vital infrastructure projects, they\u2019ll argue that engaging with crucial questions around control, ownership and access to data requires an understanding of their physical components and context.</p>\n </div>\n\n <div class=\"row\">\n  <p><b>Wesley Goatley</b> is an artist and researcher. </p>\n  <p><b>Georgina Voss</b> is a technology anthropologist, writer, and co-founder of research co-operative \u201cStrange Telemetry\u201d.</p>\n </div>\n\n</div>\n","excerpt":"","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"end_date":"2015-11-20T14:00:00+00:00","location":"Open Data Institute, 65 Clifton Street","start_date":"2015-11-20T13:00:00+00:00","booking_url":"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/friday-lunchtime-lecture-unfamiliar-topologies-tickets-19400800316","hashtag":"ODIFridays","alternative_title":"ODIFridays at the Open Data Insitute","event_type":"event:lunchtime-lecture","organizations":[],"author":{},"nodes":[]},"author":{},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-summit-and-awards-2016.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/events/odi-summit-and-awards-2016","slug":"odi-summit-and-awards-2016","title":"ODI Summit and Awards 2016","format":"event","updated_at":"2016-11-01T13:38:34+00:00","created_at":"2016-06-01T15:33:12+01:00","tag_ids":["event:panel-discussions","odi-summit","odi-awards"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/events/event%3Apanel-discussions.json","web_url":null,"title":"Panel Discussion","details":{"description":"Panel Discussion","short_description":null,"type":"event"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?event=event%3Apanel-discussions","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/event:panel-discussions","slug":"event:panel-discussions"},"parent":null},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/odi-summit.json","web_url":null,"title":"ODI Summit","details":{"description":null,"short_description":null,"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=odi-summit","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/odi-summit","slug":"odi-summit"},"parent":null},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/odi-awards.json","web_url":null,"title":"ODI Awards","details":{"description":null,"short_description":null,"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=odi-awards","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/odi-awards","slug":"odi-awards"},"parent":null}],"related":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/sir-tim-bernerslee.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/summit/2016/speakers/sir-tim-bernerslee","slug":"sir-tim-bernerslee","title":"Sir Tim Berners-Lee","format":"person","updated_at":"2016-10-12T10:11:52+01:00","created_at":"2016-08-17T15:17:13+01:00","tag_ids":["summit-speaker-2016","odi-summit"]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/sir-nigel-shadbolt.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/summit/2016/speakers/sir-nigel-shadbolt","slug":"sir-nigel-shadbolt","title":"Sir Nigel Shadbolt","format":"person","updated_at":"2016-09-28T11:55:55+01:00","created_at":"2016-08-17T16:01:51+01:00","tag_ids":["summit-speaker-2016","odi-summit"]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/baroness-martha-lane-fox.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/summit/2016/speakers/baroness-martha-lane-fox","slug":"baroness-martha-lane-fox","title":"Baroness Martha Lane Fox","format":"person","updated_at":"2016-09-28T11:50:52+01:00","created_at":"2016-08-17T16:12:08+01:00","tag_ids":["summit-speaker-2016","odi-summit"]}],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/e9/37/57e9375cd0d4624e1f00000d/Summit_option_2.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"attachment-57e9375cf362be0800000043\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Tickets are now on sale for the ODI Summit and Awards 2016.

How can the principles and practice of responsible data be incorporated into open data initiatives?</p>\n\n<p>Alix Dunn will talk about the foundations of the responsible data community, where it is headed and how responsible data tactics can inform considerations about what data is made available. She will take a look at how those decisions are made, and how intermediary organisations can help by building responsible data into their strategies.

From the social graph to the knowledge graph, the interest graph to the transactions graph, proprietary data networks drive the generation of new power and capital.</p>\n\n<p>Such graphs are used to make algorithmic predictions and optimisations about our future activities.
